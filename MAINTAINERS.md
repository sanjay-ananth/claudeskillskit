# Maintainers

This file lists the people authorised to **review, approve, and merge** pull requests into `main`.

## Current maintainers

| Name | GitHub | Role | Scope |
|---|---|---|---|
| Sanjay Ananthanarayan | [@sanjay-ananth](https://github.com/sanjay-ananth) | Lead maintainer | All skills, repo policy, releases |
| Sanjay Ananthanarayan | [@sananthanarayan](https://github.com/sananthanarayan) | Lead maintainer | All skills, repo policy, releases |

Both lead maintainers have equal authority. Either may review, approve, and merge a PR; approval from one is sufficient under the current branch-protection policy (`required_approving_review_count: 1`).

## What maintainers do

- Review every incoming PR against the [CONTRIBUTING.md](CONTRIBUTING.md) PR checklist.
- Approve PRs that pass the checklist and quality bar.
- Merge approved PRs. **Only maintainers may merge.**
- Cut releases by bumping `.claude-plugin/plugin.json` and tagging.
- Triage issues and proposals; close out-of-scope or stale work.

## What contributors do

- Open a branch, make changes, open a PR — see [CONTRIBUTING.md](CONTRIBUTING.md#branching-prs-and-merging) for the full rules.
- Respond to review feedback. Push fixes to the same branch.
- **Do not self-merge.** The bypass that maintainers have (see below) doesn't apply to contributors — the protected-branch rule blocks direct pushes to `main` from non-admin accounts.

## Maintainer bypass: direct commits to `main`

Maintainers have admin on the repo, and branch protection is configured with `enforce_admins: false` — meaning a maintainer *can* push directly to `main` without going through a PR.

This is deliberate. The PR flow is the right default and the right shape for substantive changes (and maintainers should still use it most of the time, ideally with peer review from the other maintainer). But there are situations where the audit cost of a PR exceeds its value:

- **Trivial repo hygiene** — typos in comments, fixing a broken link, version bumps after a merged PR.
- **Urgent fix** — broken `main`, leaked secret, vulnerable dependency to patch quickly.
- **Recovery** — reverting a PR that broke something.
- **Solo + can't wait** — only one maintainer online, change is non-trivial but time-sensitive.

When you bypass, the **commit message earns its keep**: explain *why* you skipped the PR, what you did to verify, and what (if anything) should be double-checked post-hoc. The audit trail moves from the PR description into the commit body.

The full guidance — including a worked-example commit message — is in [CONTRIBUTING.md → Maintainer bypass](CONTRIBUTING.md#maintainer-bypass-when-direct-commits-are-ok).

**The bypass does not extend to:**
- Force-pushing to `main` — blocked at the protection layer for everyone, including admins.
- Deleting `main` — same.
- Bypassing other maintainers' explicit objections on an in-flight PR — that's not a bypass, that's a conflict; resolve it in the PR.

## Becoming a maintainer

We don't have a formal nomination process yet because the repo is small. As a rough bar: a contributor who has landed **3+ non-trivial PRs**, demonstrates the project's [voice and tone](CONTRIBUTING.md#voice--tone-the-most-important-section), and engages constructively in review may be invited as a maintainer by an existing maintainer. Open an issue if you want to discuss it.

## Maintainer responsibilities (in order of priority)

1. **Keep the bar high.** Reject PRs that don't meet the quality bar even if they're well-intentioned — it's kinder than a slow-rotting merged skill.
2. **Be timely.** Acknowledge new PRs within a week. A response of "I'll look at this next weekend" is better than silence.
3. **Document decisions.** When a PR is closed without merging, leave a comment explaining the reason — it's how future contributors learn the project's taste.
4. **Eat our own dog food.** Use `doc-critique` on incoming SKILL.md changes; use `devils-advocate` on incoming script changes. The skills should pass their own rubrics.

## Emergency / security contact

For security-sensitive issues (vulnerable dependencies, leaked credentials in templates, etc.) — **don't open a public issue**. Contact either lead maintainer directly via GitHub, or by the email in [`.claude-plugin/plugin.json`](.claude-plugin/plugin.json).
